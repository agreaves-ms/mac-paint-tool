### Phase 1: Create Playwright Features Document

**Status**: Pass

- Document created at `.github/instructions/playwright-features.instructions.md` (896 lines)
- YAML frontmatter with `description` and `applyTo` fields present
- All 18 feature categories documented with both CLI and API examples
- Custom Agent integration guide included with SKILL template
- MCP → CLI → API mapping table present
- Project-specific pitfalls for mac-paint-tool included
- No compilation errors (only a benign link-check warning for an illustrative path inside a code block)

## Implementation Quality

- **Completeness**: All MCP tools mapped to CLI and API equivalents
- **Accuracy**: CLI commands verified against playwright-cli v0.1.1 SKILL.md; API examples verified against Playwright docs
- **Agent-readiness**: Instructions template, SKILL.md format, and tool restriction syntax included
